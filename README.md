# Zeplara Markdown Documentation
## Introduction
Zeplara is a PHP framework to make it easier for developers to create web-based applications. Zeplara itself is made as a PHP extension which is written from the Zephir language and compiled into the C language, so that applications created by developers can run quickly.

The name Zeplara itself is taken from Zephir (Zep) and laravel (Lara) and if they are combined into Zeplara. Zeplara uses the same concept as laravel, namely the MVC Framework concept, not only the concept, but Zeplara also has the same Design Pattern as Laravel. As we know, many developers make it very easy for the Laravel Framework when creating a web-based application, it's all because of the design patterns and concepts of Laravel itself.
